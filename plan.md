Let's remove the "half left"/"half right" buttons, and rename the remaining two turn buttons to be "turn left" and "turn right" respectively. Let's also update the effect. Currently the boat spins almost 360 degrees. I would like each turn command to turn the boat only about 15 degrees at a time.


Let's update the canvas so that when the player sails into an edge, it wraps the boat around to the opposite edge (so they don't stop when they hit the edge). The target should not wrap - it should remain oscillating left and right.
